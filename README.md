# console-log-mobile
View javascript console.log status in css layer - perfect in mobile use

View the index.html example.
Your testing code have to be between: "// YOUR CUSTOM CODE - EXAMPLE:"
and "// YOUR CUSTOM CODE - END"

The external javascript and my console script are necessary.
Dont rename: "gnConsoleLog()" and "gnConsoleRun();"

I try to make this (next update) more simpler.
